#.  You can use a numeric TOS values, or use
#.  .br
#.  iptables -j TOS -h
#.  .br
#.  to see the list of valid TOS names.
#.  .SS MIRROR
#.  This is an experimental demonstration target which inverts the source
#.  and destination fields in the IP header and retransmits the packet.
#.  It is only valid in the
#.  .BR INPUT ,
#.  .B FORWARD
#.  and 
#.  .B PREROUTING
#.  chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those
#.  chains.  Note that the outgoing packets are
#.  .B NOT
#.  seen by any packet filtering chains, connection tracking or NAT, to
#.  avoid loops and other problems.
#.  .SS SNAT
#.  This target is only valid in the 
#.  .B nat
#.  table, in the 
#.  .B POSTROUTING
#.  chain.  It specifies that the source address of the packet should be
#.  modified (and all future packets in this connection will also be
#.  mangled), and rules should cease being examined.  It takes one option:
#.  .TP
#.  .BR "--to-source  " "\fIipaddr\fP[-\fIipaddr\fP][:\fIport\fP-\fIport\fP]"
#.  which can specify a single new source IP address, an inclusive range
#.  of IP addresses, and optionally, a port range (which is only valid if
#.  the rule also specifies
#.  .B "-p tcp"
#.  or
#.  .BR "-p udp" ).
#.  If no port range is specified, then source ports below 512 will be
#.  mapped to other ports below 512: those between 512 and 1023 inclusive
#.  will be mapped to ports below 1024, and other ports will be mapped to
#.  1024 or above. Where possible, no port alteration will occur.
#.  .SS DNAT
#.  This target is only valid in the 
#.  .B nat
#.  table, in the 
#.  .B PREROUTING
#.  and
#.  .B OUTPUT
#.  chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those
#.  chains.  It specifies that the destination address of the packet
#.  should be modified (and all future packets in this connection will
#.  also be mangled), and rules should cease being examined.  It takes one
#.  option:
#.  .TP
#.  .BR "--to-destination " "\fIipaddr\fP[-\fIipaddr\fP][:\fIport\fP-\fIport\fP]"
#.  which can specify a single new destination IP address, an inclusive
#.  range of IP addresses, and optionally, a port range (which is only
#.  valid if the rule also specifies
#.  .B "-p tcp"
#.  or
#.  .BR "-p udp" ).
#.  If no port range is specified, then the destination port will never be
#.  modified.
#.  .SS MASQUERADE
#.  This target is only valid in the 
#.  .B nat
#.  table, in the 
#.  .B POSTROUTING
#.  chain.  It should only be used with dynamically assigned IP (dialup)
#.  connections: if you have a static IP address, you should use the SNAT
#.  target.  Masquerading is equivalent to specifying a mapping to the IP
#.  address of the interface the packet is going out, but also has the
#.  effect that connections are 
#.  .I forgotten
#.  when the interface goes down.  This is the correct behavior when the
#.  next dialup is unlikely to have the same interface address (and hence
#.  any established connections are lost anyway).  It takes one option:
#.  .TP
#.  .BR "--to-ports " "\fIport\fP[-\fIport\fP]"
#.  This specifies a range of source ports to use, overriding the default 
#.  .B SNAT
#.  source port-selection heuristics (see above).  This is only valid
#.  if the rule also specifies
#.  .B "-p tcp"
#.  or
#.  .BR "-p udp" .
#.  .SS REDIRECT
#.  This target is only valid in the 
#.  .B nat
#.  table, in the 
#.  .B PREROUTING
#.  and
#.  .B OUTPUT
#.  chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those
#.  chains.  It alters the destination IP address to send the packet to
#.  the machine itself (locally-generated packets are mapped to the
#.  127.0.0.1 address).  It takes one option:
#.  .TP
#.  .BR "--to-ports " "\fIport\fP[-\fIport\fP]"
#.  This specifies a destination port or range of ports to use: without
#.  this, the destination port is never altered.  This is only valid
#.  if the rule also specifies
#.  .B "-p tcp"
#.  or
#.  .BR "-p udp" .
