"I<Gzip> reduces the size of the named files using Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77).  "
"Whenever possible, each file is replaced by one with the extension "
"B<\\&.gz,> while keeping the same ownership modes, access and modification "
"times.  (The default extension is B<-gz> for VMS, B<z> for MSDOS, OS/2 FAT, "
"Windows NT FAT and Atari.)  If no files are specified, or if a file name is "
"\"-\", the standard input is compressed to the standard output.  I<Gzip> "
"will only attempt to compress regular files.  In particular, it will ignore "
"symbolic links."

"If the compressed file name is too long for its file system, I<gzip> "
"truncates it.  I<Gzip> attempts to truncate only the parts of the file name "
"longer than 3 characters.  (A part is delimited by dots.) If the name "
"consists of small parts only, the longest parts are truncated. For example, "
"if file names are limited to 14 characters, gzip.msdos.exe is compressed to "
"gzi.msd.exe.gz.  Names are not truncated on systems which do not have a "
"limit on file name length."

"I<gunzip> can currently decompress files created by I<gzip, zip, compress, "

"When using the first two formats, I<gunzip> checks a 32 bit CRC. For I<pack, "
"gunzip> checks the uncompressed length. The standard I<compress> format was "
"not designed to allow consistency checks. However I<gunzip> is sometimes "
"able to detect a bad .Z file. If you get an error when uncompressing a .Z "
"file, do not assume that the .Z file is correct simply because the standard "
"I<uncompress> does not complain. This generally means that the standard "
"I<uncompress> does not check its input, and happily generates garbage "
