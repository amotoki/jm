"The purpose of the I<make> utility is to determine automatically which "
"pieces of a large program need to be recompiled, and issue the commands to "
"recompile them.  The manual describes the GNU implementation of I<make>, "
"which was written by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath, and is currently "
"maintained by Paul Smith.  Our examples show C programs, since they are most "
"common, but you can use I<make> with any programming language whose compiler "
"can be run with a shell command.  In fact, I<make> is not limited to "
"programs.  You can use it to describe any task where some files must be "
"updated automatically from others whenever the others change."

"To prepare to use I<make>, you must write a file called the I<makefile> that "
"describes the relationships among files in your program, and the states the "
"commands for updating each file.  In a program, typically the executable "
"file is updated from object files, which are in turn made by compiling "
"source files."
