networks \- network name information
.SH 説明
The file \fI/etc/networks\fP is a plain ASCII file that describes known DARPA
networks and symbolic names for these networks.  Each line represents a
network and has the following structure:

.RS
\fIname number aliases ...\fP
.RE

where the fields are delimited by spaces or tabs.  Empty lines are ignored.
The hash character (\fB#\fP) indicates the start of a comment: this character,
and the remaining characters up to the end of the current line, are ignored
by library functions that process the file.

フィールドの説明は以下のとおり。

.TP 
\fIname\fP
The symbolic name for the network.  Network names can contain any printable
characters execept white\-space characters or the comment character.
.TP 
\fInumber\fP
The official number for this network in numbers\-and\-dots notation (see
\fBinet\fP(3)).  The trailing ".0" (for the host component of the network
address) may be omitted.
.TP 
\fIaliases\fP
Optional aliases for the network.
.LP

This file is read by the \fBroute\fP(8)  and \fBnetstat\fP(8)  utilities.  Only
Class A, B or C networks are supported, partitioned networks (i.e.,
network/26 or network/28) are not supported by this facility.
