.TH GETUTMP 3 2010\-09\-10 Linux "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH 名前
getutmp, getutmpx \- copy utmp structure to utmpx, and vice versa
.SH 書式
.nf
\fB#define _GNU_SOURCE\fP             /* See feature_test_macros(7) */
\fB#include <utmpx.h>\fP

\fB void getutmp(const struct utmpx *\fP\fIux\fP\fB, struct utmp *\fP\fIu\fP\fB);\fP
\fB void getutmpx(const struct utmp *\fP\fIu\fP\fB, struct utmpx *\fP\fIux\fP\fB);\fP
.fi
.SH 説明
The \fBgetutmp\fP()  function copies the fields of the \fIutmpx\fP structure
pointed to by \fIux\fP to the corresponding fields of the \fIutmp\fP structure
pointed to by \fIu\fP.  The \fBgetutmpx\fP()  function performs the converse
operation.
.SH 返り値
These functions do not return a value.
.SH VERSIONS
These functions first appeared in glibc in version 2.1.1.
.SH 準拠
These functions are nonstandard, but appear on a few other systems, such as
Solaris and NetBSD.
.SH 注意
.\" e.g., on Solaris, the utmpx structure is rather larger than utmp.
These functions exist primarily for compatibility with other systems where
the \fIutmp\fP and \fIutmpx\fP structures contain different fields, or the size of
corresponding fields differs.  On Linux, the two structures contain the same
fields, and the fields have the same sizes.
