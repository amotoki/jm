.SH 説明
A device ID consists of two parts: a major ID, identifying the class of the
device, and a minor ID, identifying a specific instance of a device in that
class.  A device ID is represented using the type \fIdev_t\fP.

Given major and minor device IDs, \fBmakedev\fP()  combines these to produce a
device ID, returned as the function result.  This device ID can be given to
\fBmknod\fP(2), for example.

The \fBmajor\fP()  and \fBminor\fP()  functions perform the converse task: given a
device ID, they return, respectively, the major and minor components.  These
macros can be useful to, for example, decompose the device IDs in the
structure returned by \fBstat\fP(2).

The \fBmakedev\fP(), \fBmajor\fP(), and \fBminor\fP()  functions are not specified in
POSIX.1, but are present on many other systems.
.SH 注意
These interfaces are defined as macros.  Since glibc 2.3.3, they have been
aliases for three GNU\-specific functions: \fBgnu_dev_makedev\fP(),
\fBgnu_dev_major\fP(), and \fBgnu_dev_minor\fP().  The latter names are exported,
but the traditional names are more portable.
