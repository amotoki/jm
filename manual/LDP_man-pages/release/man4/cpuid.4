.SH 名前
cpuid \- x86 CPUID access device
.SH 説明
CPUID provides an interface for querying information about the x86 CPU.

This device is accessed by \fBlseek (2)\fP or \fBpread (2)\fP to the appropriate
CPUID level and reading in chunks of 16 bytes.  A larger read size means
multiple reads of consecutive levels.

The lower 32 bits of the file position is used as the incoming \fI%eax\fP, and
the upper 32 bits of the file position as the incoming \fI%ecx\fP, the latter
intended for "counting" \fIeax\fP levels like \fIeax=4\fP.

This driver uses \fI/dev/cpu/CPUNUM/cpuid\fP, where \fICPUNUM\fP is the minor
number, and on an SMP box will direct the access to CPU \fICPUNUM\fP as listed
in \fI/proc/cpuinfo\fP.

This file is protected so that it can only be read by the user \fIroot\fP, or
members of the group \fIroot\fP.
.SH 注意
The CPUID instruction can be directly executed by a program using inline
assembler.  However this device allows convenient access to all CPUs without
changing process affinity.

Most of the information in \fIcpuid\fP is reported by the kernel in cooked form
either in \fI/proc/cpuinfo\fP or through subdirectories in
\fI/sys/devices/system/cpu\fP.  Direct CPUID access through this device should
only be used in exceptional cases.

The \fIcpuid\fP driver is not auto\-loaded.  On modular kernels you might need
to use the following command to load it explicitly before use:

     $ \fImodprobe cpuid\fP

There is no support for CPUID functions that require additional input
registers.

Very old x86 CPUs don't support CPUID.
