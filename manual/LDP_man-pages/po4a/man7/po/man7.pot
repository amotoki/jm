#: build/C/man7/futex.7:25
msgid ""
"The Linux kernel provides futexes (\"Fast user-space mutexes\")  as a "
"building block for fast user-space locking and semaphores.  Futexes are very "
"basic and lend themselves well for building higher level locking "
"abstractions such as POSIX mutexes."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: build/C/man7/futex.7:32
msgid ""
"This page does not set out to document all design decisions but restricts "
"itself to issues relevant for application and library development.  Most "
"programmers will in fact not be using futexes directly but instead rely on "
"system libraries built on them, such as the NPTL pthreads implementation."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: build/C/man7/futex.7:39
msgid ""
"A futex is identified by a piece of memory which can be shared between "
"different processes.  In these different processes, it need not have "
"identical addresses.  In its bare form, a futex has semaphore semantics; it "
"is a counter that can be incremented and decremented atomically; processes "
"can wait for the value to become positive."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: build/C/man7/futex.7:44
msgid ""
"Futex operation is entirely user space for the noncontended case.  The "
"kernel is involved only to arbitrate the contended case.  As any sane design "
"will strive for noncontention, futexes are also optimized for this "
"situation."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: build/C/man7/futex.7:51
msgid ""
"In its bare form, a futex is an aligned integer which is touched only by "
"atomic assembler instructions.  Processes can share this integer using "
"B<mmap>(2), via shared memory segments or because they share memory space, "
"in which case the application is commonly called multithreaded."

"To \"up\" a futex, execute the proper assembler instructions that will cause "
"the host CPU to atomically increment the integer.  Afterward, check if it "
"has in fact changed from 0 to 1, in which case there were no waiters and the "
"operation is done.  This is the noncontended case which is fast and should "
"be common."

"In the contended case, the atomic increment changed the counter from -1 (or "

msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Waiting on a futex, to \"down\" it, is the reverse operation.  Atomically "
"decrement the counter and check if it changed to 0, in which case the "
"operation is done and the futex was uncontended.  In all other "
"circumstances, the process should set the counter to -1 and request that the "
"kernel wait for another process to up the futex.  This is done using the "
"B<FUTEX_WAIT> operation."

"The B<futex>(2)  system call can optionally be passed a timeout specifying "
