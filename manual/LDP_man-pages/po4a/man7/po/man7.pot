msgid ""
"The Linux kernel provides futexes (\"Fast Userspace muTexes\")  as a "
"building block for fast userspace locking and semaphores.  Futexes are very "
"basic and lend themselves well for building higher level locking "
"abstractions such as POSIX mutexes."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: build/C/man7/futex.7:29
msgid ""
"This page does not set out to document all design decisions but restricts "
"itself to issues relevant for application and library development.  Most "
"programmers will in fact not be using futexes directly but instead rely on "
"system libraries built on them, such as the NPTL pthreads implementation."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: build/C/man7/futex.7:36
msgid ""
"A futex is identified by a piece of memory which can be shared between "
"different processes.  In these different processes, it need not have "
"identical addresses.  In its bare form, a futex has semaphore semantics; it "
"is a counter that can be incremented and decremented atomically; processes "
"can wait for the value to become positive."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: build/C/man7/futex.7:41
msgid ""
"Futex operation is entirely userspace for the noncontended case.  The kernel "
"is only involved to arbitrate the contended case.  As any sane design will "
"strive for noncontention, futexes are also optimized for this situation."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"In its bare form, a futex is an aligned integer which is only touched by "
"atomic assembler instructions.  Processes can share this integer using "
"B<mmap>(2), via shared memory segments or because they share memory space, "

"To \"up\" a futex, execute the proper assembler instructions that will cause "
"the host CPU to atomically increment the integer.  Afterward, check if it "

"In the contended case, the atomic increment changed the counter from -1 (or "

"Waiting on a futex, to \"down\" it, is the reverse operation.  Atomically "
"decrement the counter and check if it changed to 0, in which case the "
"operation is done and the futex was uncontended.  In all other "
"circumstances, the process should set the counter to -1 and request that the "
