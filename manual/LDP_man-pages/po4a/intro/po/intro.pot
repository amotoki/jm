"Although technically B<man> is a troff macro package, in reality a large "

"B<tbl>(1), but try to use the B<IP> and B<TP> commands instead for "
"two-column tables).  Avoid using computations; most other tools can't "
"process them.  Use simple commands that are easy to translate to other "
"formats.  The following troff macros are believed to be safe (though in many "

"B<br>, B<ce>, B<de>, B<ds>, B<el>, B<ie>, B<if>, B<fi>, B<ft>, B<hy>, B<ig>, "

"Most of the macros describe formatting (e.g., font type and spacing) instead "

"page), compared to formats like mdoc and DocBook (even HTML has more "
"semantic markings).  This situation makes it harder to vary the B<man> "

"formatting package for E<.Xr troff 1>.  Its predecessor, the E<.Xr \\-man 7> "
"package, addressed page layout leaving the manipulation of fonts and other "
"typesetting details to the individual author.  In E<.Nm \\-mdoc>, page "
"layout macros make up the E<.Em \"page structure domain\"> which consists of "
"macros for titles, section headers, displays and lists.  Essentially items "
"which affect the physical position of text on a formatted page.  In addition "
"to the page structure domain, there are two more domains, the manual domain "
"and the general text domain.  The general text domain is defined as macros "
"which perform tasks such as quoting or emphasizing pieces of text.  The "
"manual domain is defined as macros that are a subset of the day to day "
"informal language used to describe commands, routines and related E<.Bx> "
"files.  Macros in the manual domain handle command names, command-line "
"arguments and options, function names, function parameters, pathnames, "
"variables, cross references to other manual pages, and so on.  These domain "
"items have value for both the author and the future user of the manual "
"page.  It is hoped the consistency gained across the manual set will provide "
"easier translation to future documentation tools."
