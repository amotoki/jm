"When exchanging data between systems, both systems have to agree on the "
"physical tape block size.  The parameters of a drive after startup are often "
"not the ones most operating systems use with these devices.  Most systems "
"use drives in variable-block mode if the drive supports that mode.  This "
"applies to most modern drives, including DATs, 8mm helical scan drives, "
"DLTs, etc.  It may be advisable to use these drives in variable-block mode "
"also in Linux (i.e., use B<MTSETBLK> or B<MTSETDEFBLK> at system startup to "
"set the mode), at least when exchanging data with a foreign system.  The "
"drawback of this is that a fairly large tape block size has to be used to "

"The URI syntax was designed to be unambiguous.  However, as URIs have become "
"commonplace, traditional media (television, radio, newspapers, billboards, "
"etc.) have increasingly used abbreviated URI references consisting of only "
"the authority and path portions of the identified resource (e.g., "
"E<lt>www.w3.org/AddressingE<gt>).  Such references are primarily intended "
"for human interpretation rather than machine, with the assumption that "
"context-based heuristics are sufficient to complete the URI (e.g., hostnames "
"beginning with \"www\" are likely to have a URI prefix of \"http://\" and "
"hostnames beginning with \"ftp\" likely to have a prefix of \"ftp://\").  "
"Many client implementations heuristically resolve these references.  Such "
"heuristics may change over time, particularly when new schemes are "
"introduced.  Since an abbreviated URI has the same syntax as a relative URL "
"path, abbreviated URI references cannot be used where relative URIs are "
"permitted, and can only be used when there is no defined base (such as in "
"dialog boxes).  Don't use abbreviated URIs as hypertext links inside a "
