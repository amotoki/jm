#.  LILO can boot DOS, OS/2, Linux, FreeBSD, UnixWare, etc., and is quite flexible.
#
#.  The other commonly used Linux loader is 'LoadLin', which is a DOS
#.  program that has the capability to launch a Linux kernel from the DOS
#.  prompt (with boot-args) assuming that certain resources are available.
#.  This is good for people that want to launch Linux from DOS.
#
#.  It is also very useful if you have certain hardware which relies on
#.  the supplied DOS driver to put the hardware into a known state.
#.  A common example is 'SoundBlaster Compatible' sound cards that require
#.  the DOS driver to twiddle a few mystical registers to put the card
#.  into a SB compatible mode.
#.  Booting DOS with the supplied driver, and
#.  then loading Linux from the DOS prompt with loadlin avoids the reset
