"In Linux 3.13 and earlier, if B<msgrcv>()  was called with the B<MSG_COPY> "
"flag, but without B<IPC_NOWAIT>, and the message queue contained less than "
"I<msgtyp> messages, then the call would block until the next message is "
"written to the queue.  At that point, the call would return a copy of the "
"message, I<regardless> of whether that message was at the ordinal position "
"I<msgtyp>.  This bug is fixed in Linux 3.14."

"Specifying both B<MSG_COPY> and B<MSC_EXCEPT> in I<msgflg> is a logical "
"error (since these flags impose different interpretations on I<msgtyp>).  In "
"Linux 3.13 and earlier, this error was not diagnosed by B<msgrcv>().  This "
